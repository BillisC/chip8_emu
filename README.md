# chip8_emu
This is a chip8 emulator written in C++  
This implementation is running at aproximately 6MHz(May be changed in the future).  
Apparently not all games work equally well because of the lack of clock speed in the documentation which means that anyone can make games that work at different clock speeds (May add a custom clock option on launch commands).  

## Building
To build the emulator you simply need to type:
```
make
```

## Executing
To run the emulator use the following command:
```
./chip8.exe {INSERT_ROM_PATH_HERE}
```

## Debugging
*Coming soon*
